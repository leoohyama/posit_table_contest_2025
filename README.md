## Background/Context
I work as a Data Science Coordinator for the New Worlds Reading Program. New Worlds Reading is Florida’s free at-home program that mails 9 free books to eligible VPK - 5th graders each school year. Plus, deliveries include reading activities and resources families can use to help build kids’ reading skills. Books and materials are available in English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and braille. To be eligible, kids must be VPK - 5th graders who are not yet meeting grade level expectations in reading in Florida VPK programs, public schools, and charter schools.

## The problem
Every year, our goal as reading program is to enroll as many eligible students as possible. Given this, getting readable and actionable information on eligibility and enrollment numbers on schools (2,400+) across 76 districts passed on to internal team members (many of whom operate remotely across the state of Florida) who engage with underserved communities is a critical data pipeline. This is especially daunting when the number of children is close to ~ 1.35 million.
